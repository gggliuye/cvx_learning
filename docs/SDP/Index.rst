**SDP**

* Introduction of SDP, several examples of SDP.
* Duality properties, dual problem is also SDP, optimal conditions, duality gap, primal-dual problem.
* Log-barrier function, analytic center, central path (objective function, duality gap).

In summary, primal-dual algorithms for semidefinite programs share many of the features
and characteristics of the corresponding algorithms for LPs. Our final conclusion is
therefore that it is not much harder to solve a rather wide class of nonlinear convex
optimization problems than it is to solve LPs.
