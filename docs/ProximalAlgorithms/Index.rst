Proximal Algorithms
==============================

`Link of the Site <https://moonlight-cvx-learning.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest>`_

This pages are my notes when learning Proxima Algorithms from the materials online, mainly from stanford engineer pages :
 `EE364b <https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures.html>`_ , `Proximal Algorithms <http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/prox_algs.html>`_,
 and `Math301 <https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/teaching/math301/>`_.

These pages will include the important definitions, some of my interpretations, and more derivatives and proofs than the original handouts.
These pages are corresponding with the paper `Proximal Algorithms Foundations and Trends in Optimization 2014 <http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/prox_algs.pdf>`_
