On the Unification of Line Processes, Outlier Rejection, and Robust Statistics with Applications in Early Vision. `paper <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anand_Rangarajan/publication/228083825_On_the_unification_of_line_processes_outlier_rejection_and_robuststatistics_with_applications_to_early_vision/links/54ca4af70cf2c70ce521a907.pdf>`_
published 1995.

This paper mainly shows the unification of **line process** (mainly used in Robust Statistics) and **outlier rejection**.

Involving problems:

* Surface Recovery
* Image Segmentation (recovery of piecewise smooth regions using reguarization)
* Image Reconstruction
* Optical Flow
