1. Introduction
=============================

**Background:** BigData -> extremely large amount of data. Very high-dimensional data, distributed stored data.

* Decentralized collection or storage.
* Distributed solution methods (e.g. ADMM).

Closely related algorithms:

* Dual Decomposition. (explained in Chapter 2)
* The method of multipliers. (explained in Chapter 2)
* Douglas-Rachford splitting.
* Spingarn's method of partial inverses.
* Dykstra's alternating projections.
* Bregman iterative algorithms for l1 problems.
* Proximal algorithms.


**ADMM: The blender of the decomposability of dual ascent with the superior convergence properties of the method of multipliers.**
