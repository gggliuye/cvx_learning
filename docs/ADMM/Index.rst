==============================

**Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers**

`Link of the Site <https://cvx-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

This pages are my notes when learning Proxima Algorithms from the materials online, mainly from stanford engineer pages :
 `EE364b <https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures.html>`_ ,and  `ADMM <http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html>`_ .

These pages will include the important definitions, some of my interpretations, and more derivatives and proofs than the original handouts.
These pages are corresponding with the paper `Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers 2010 <http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/admm_distr_stats.pdf>`_
